# DynamoDB CloudFormation Deployment

The DynamoDB CloudFormation Deployment project aims to provide an automated and repeatable way to provision and manage Amazon DynamoDB resources using AWS CloudFormation. This repository contains the necessary templates and configurations to deploy and maintain DynamoDB tables, indexes, and other related resources in a seamless manner.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
    - An AWS account with appropriate permissions to create CloudFormation stacks and DynamoDB resources.
    - AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) installed and configured with the necessary credentials.

### Deployment

## Usage
Once the CloudFormation stack is successfully deployed, you can interact with the DynamoDB resources using the AWS SDKs, AWS Management Console, or any other AWS-compatible tooling. Make sure to reference the table names, indexes, and other configurations defined in your CloudFormation template.

## Configuration
The dynamodb-template.yaml CloudFormation template provides a range of configuration options for DynamoDB resources. You can customize table names, provisioned throughput, indexing strategies, and more using CloudFormation parameters.
